# O
I have learnt the procedure of test driven development, which involves writing test cases, implementing the functions, and refactoring.

# R
Slightly skeptical but open-minded

# I
I think TDD may take more time than my current practice which might not be applicable at work due to schedule. But, test driven development could help us to mitigate bugs as early as possible which could be quite beneficial to overall development. It helps to reduce cost (time and effort) needed to debug.

# D
I could try to adopt such development process at work if time allows. Most of the time, projects has tight schedule and sometimes, we might not even have time to write test cases while developing. If there is sufficient time, I could try TDD to help me make debugging less time-consuming.
